The Hawaii Space Flight Laboratory (HSFL) was established in May 2007 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. As a multidisciplinary research and education center, HSFL brings together individuals from diverse areas to work on the exploration and understanding of the space environment. HSFL designs, builds, launches and operate microsatellites in the 1-150 kg range that can be configured for a variety of science and educational missions.

HSFL aims to:

- Promote innovative engineering and science research for terrestrial and planetary space missions
- Develop, launch, and operate small spacecraft from the Hawaiian Islands to accelerate the validation of new space technologies
- Provide workforce training in all aspects of unmanned space missions
- Build synergistic collaborations among educational, governmental, and corporate institutions interested in space exploration
