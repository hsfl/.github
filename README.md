# Welcome to the Hawaii Space Flight Laboratory GitHub page

The Hawaii Space Flight Laboratory (HSFL) was established in May 2007 within the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST) and the College of Engineering (CoE) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. HSFL is also embedded as a laboratory of the Hawaiâ€™i Institute of Geophysics and Planetology (HIGP). As a multidisciplinary research and education center, HSFL brings together individuals from diverse areas to work on the exploration and understanding of the space environment. HSFL enables the University of Hawaii to design, build, launch and operate microsatellites in the 1-150 kg range that can be configured for a variety of science and educational tasks.

As a research facility, HSFL aims to:

- Promote innovative engineering and science research for terrestrial and planetary space missions
- Develop, launch, and operate small spacecraft from the Hawaiian Islands to accelerate the validation of new space technologies
- Provide workforce training in all aspects of unmanned space missions
- Build synergistic collaborations among educational, governmental, and corporate institutions interested in space exploration
